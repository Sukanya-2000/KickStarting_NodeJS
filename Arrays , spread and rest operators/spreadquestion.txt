What according to you is spread opertor. Does spread operator create a new object or point to the same old object?

Ans: The spread operator is a JavaScript operator that allows you to expand the elements of an iterable object into individual elements. It is often used to create copies of arrays or objects.

	The spread operator can also be used to create copies of objects. For example, the following code creates a new object that contains all of the properties of the original object, plus the property name: 

const originalObject = { age: 23, occupation: "Software Engineer" }; 

const newObject = { ...originalObject, name: "Sukanya Bhattacharyya" }; 

console.log(newObject);
